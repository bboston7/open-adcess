Certain exemptions to our restrictions on use are made for priority research at the ACM. One such area is the emerging field of bioengineering.

The Assembly of Consultants for Madison Ave. has found that consumers have been engaging with ads in a very half-hearted way. Our researchers were using terminology like ``impressions" or ``exposures,"
as if an interaction with an ad were a mere interaction with a parking lot flasher, easily forgotten (in the mind of the flasher). Such terminology fails to 
capture the liberatory synergy of consumer-brand engagement.\footnote{The ACM once prioritized research into computational models of interaction with brands,
of human interaction with brands. Unfortunately, this research was scuttled after researchers discovered that engagement is 
undecidable. It appears that the interaction between person and brand is, like Post's Correspondence Problem, too synergistic.
Thus, either certain people and brands will never interact, or the Extended Church-Turing thesis is violated. This is why there
are no ads in the executive quarters of the ACM.} And it encourages consumers to neglect ads---to refuse to engage with them in a
serious, heartfelt way.(snotty Cynthia Ozick quote about reading)

To combat (apathy/insufficient committment to engagement/treason), the ACM has been seeking ways to make ads stick into consumers'
minds, to make a splash. For instance, just last year the ACM launched a native ad campaign whereby ACM Cola will dump you in 
front of the whole eighth grade. The ACM wants to go bigger and is putting a lot of resources into advertising technology.

After conquering \emph{Nature}, the ACM is seeking to conquer nature. Beginning several decades ago, the ACM began paying
nature to conform to its wishes. Birds of several species including the red-breasted goon and the (mob name nuthatch)
were paid to trace out the names of ACM products and fly in formations that constellate 
into the logos of ACM brands. People who gave birth to corporate logos received free products from the associated brand. Inspired
by the birth of Satan (the original brand ambassador and current mascot of ACM Lil' Devil Snack Cakes) in the film \emph{Rosemary's
Baby}, the ACM offered anyone willing to give birth to the mascot of ACM Burger Town\footnote{Namely, the combined hamburger
thief and king, who wears a prisoner's outfit and sports a crown, an honest illegitimate ruler who makes the official
Currency Partner of ACM, Burger Town, valuable by demanding the \emph{dizaine} tax payment of ten burgers per day.} two free
hamburgers. Evolution has no direction, but money talks.

However, the ACM has discovered that there are limits to this approach. Inspired by the prior work of the lancet river fluke
\cite{fluke}, the ACM has begun paying parasites to hijack your brain and
encourage the consumption of ACM Bleach. To encourage adoption of this ad vector, the ACM has purchased billboards
throughout the world that say \textsc{This Year, Give (Her) Untreated Water}.

The president of the ACM was bribed with "alien bucks" by ostensible aliens
who didn't even promise to not murder him or other members of the human race in exchange for tender that was neither legal nor
wanted on a planet whose governments' taxes aren't violently collected in that currency.
ACM: scientists who work on reproducing class privilege perfectly while calling it meritocratic (meritocracy is kleptocracy with good PR) -- the so-called Jared Kushner problem
PR so good one can speak the plain truth w/o fear of causing ill discipline in the factories because nobody will internalize the truth.
