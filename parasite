Certain exemptions to our restrictions on use are made for priority research at the ACM. One such area is the emerging field of bioengineering.\footnote{The
so-called Jared Bushner problem of enabling unlimited intergenerational wealth, status, and ORCID ID transfer in a society that 
is a meritocracy---that is, a kleptocracy with really good PR.}

The Assembly of Consultants for Madison Ave. has found that consumers have been engaging with ads in a very half-hearted way. Our researchers were using terminology like ``impressions" or ``exposures,"
as if an interaction with an ad were a mere interaction with a parking lot flasher, easily forgotten (in the mind of the flasher). Such terminology fails to 
capture the liberatory synergy of consumer-brand engagement.\footnote{The ACM once prioritized research into computational models of interaction with brands,
of human interaction with brands. Unfortunately, this research was scuttled after researchers discovered that engagement is 
undecidable. It appears that the interaction between person and brand is, like Post's Correspondence Problem, too synergistic.
Thus, either certain people and brands will never interact, or the Extended Church-Turing thesis is violated. This is why there
are no ads in the executive quarters of the ACM.} And it encourages consumers to neglect ads---to refuse to engage with them in a
serious, heartfelt way.(snotty Cynthia Ozick quote about reading)

To combat (apathy/insufficient committment to engagement/treason), the ACM has been seeking ways to make ads stick into consumers'
minds, to make a splash. For instance, just last year the ACM launched a native ad campaign whereby ACM Cola will dump you in 
front of the whole eighth grade. The ACM wants to go bigger and is putting a lot of resources into advertising technology.

After conquering \emph{Nature}, the ACM is seeking to conquer nature. Beginning several decades ago, the ACM began paying
nature to conform to its wishes. Birds of several species including the red-breasted goon and the (mob name nuthatch)
were paid to trace out the names of ACM products and fly in formations that constellate 
into the logos of ACM brands. People who gave birth to corporate logos received free products from the associated brand. Inspired
by the birth of Satan (the original brand ambassador and current mascot of ACM Lil' Devil Snack Cakes) in the film \emph{Rosemary's
Baby}, the ACM offered anyone willing to give birth to the mascot of ACM Burger Town\footnote{Namely, the combined hamburger
thief and king, who wears a prisoner's outfit and sports a crown, an honest illegitimate ruler who makes the official
Currency Partner of ACM, Burger Town, valuable by demanding the \emph{dizaine} tax payment of ten burgers per day.} two free
hamburgers. Evolution has no direction, but money talks.\footnote{The president of the ACM was bribed with so-called ``alien
bucks," which is of little interest to Earthlings as no Earth-bound tax collector goes near the stuff, by ostensible aliens
or perhaps a lizard who stayed at an ACM Inn Express last night or a couple of guys who watch a lot of the ACM History Network.
The president didn't even get in exchange for the bribe a promise of peace or clemency. As a result, ACM researchers are not
allowed to look into cat parasites too closely and are told that the intended target is not humans.}

However, the ACM has discovered that there are limits to this approach. Inspired by the prior work of the lancet river fluke
\cite{fluke}, the ACM began paying parasites to hijack your brain and encourage consumption of ACM Bleach.
To ensure mass adoption of this ad vector, the ACM purchased billboards throughout the world that said 
\textsc{This Year, Give (Her) Untreated Water}. Unfortunately, this ad campaign depressed sales more than the
parasites increased sales, so the campaign was scrapped.

It is the hope of the ACM that bioengineers, taking cues from the success of the ``Bud-Wei-Ser" gene drive frogs,
develop a parasite that will help the ACM develop better ads or at least get their ads to be read charitably by the public.
