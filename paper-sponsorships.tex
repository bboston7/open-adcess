\subsection{Banner ads}
\todo{Autoplayed music ads.  Attempts to hijack other devices in household to
display ACM related ads.}

\subsection{Ad Enhanced Fonts}
\todo{Computer modern replaced with characters replaced by logos}

\subsection{Native Ads}
\todo{Content that seems like research but is actually an ad}

\subsection{Branded mathematical objects}
We believe there has been a missed opportunity in the field of mathematics to
increase brand awareness.
Therefore, we propose branding mathematical objects by associating every single
set with an individual brand.
Brands can purchase large collections of sets at a discount.
While most sets are cheap, some more famous sets will sell for more to reflect
the higher market value, similar to domain names.
Thus, ACM will create an ICANN equivalent for these sets.

Authors referencing any given set must reference the brand of the set any time
the set is referenced, regardless of the format the set is presented  in.
Additionally, royalties must be paid to the owner of the set.

We are excited to announce that our first partner in this endeavor will be
Chill's Grill \& Bar, who has purchased the rights to the set of natural
numbers.
From here on, authors must refer to this set as the Chill's Grill \& Bar Set of
Natural Numbers \(\mathbb{N}\)\copyright.

\subsection{ACM Classifieds}
For additional funding we allow individuals to take out classified ads in the
following sections.
To keep costs low, the ACM does not vet any classified postings.

\paragraph{Dropped Packets}
Dropped Packets serves as the traditional missed connections section of the
classifieds.
While this could be used to contact that cutie \todo{sp?} from the latest
conference, we believe that it could also be used to publicly shame those who
miss meetings.
For example, ``Damn it Dave, you were supposed to bring bagels to the DARPA
Tactical Anti-\censor{blank} HAVE BAGEL Infiltration \censor{long blank}
(DTA\censor{b}HBI\censor{bb}) meeting!"

\paragraph{Job Queue}
The Job Queue section contains odd jobs for trained Computer Scientists looking
for instant internet income.
Those who pay extra will get a free AirDancer\footnote{Placed at the discretion
of the ACM in the ACM AirDancer Oasis in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada in
solidarity with the aliens illegally detained in Area 51.  The AirDancers may
be used by the alien's to communicate with their home world}!
We will be posting the first jobs ourselves such as,
Snapchat is known for taking out ads in classifieds \todo{cite from LA times}.

\paragraph{Overclock}
Overclock is a section for performance enhancing drugs tailored for computer
scientists.
This section is mostly targeted to the Hacker News crowd who exclaims the
benefits of small amounts of LSD for enhancing productivity at work
\todo{cite}.
Although we can't promote the use of illegal drugs our editor is so strung out
on ``road cheese" that she won't notice.
